# DistributedQuantumAnnealing

Here is the code used to simulate the systems in the thesis.

The lib folder has all the classes and scripts used.

The pipfile has all the python libraries necessary to run the code. 

Once the libraries are installed, run

`./lib/task_man.py`

It will go to each folder specified in `queued-tasks.log` and run the simulations for those parameters.
